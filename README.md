# Inventory-Management

This inventory management system focuses on automating the ordering of supplies without requiring manual interaction.
This system consists of a user, Local storage, Warehouse, Admin. When a supply is required, the user will open a ticket in our platform and specify the product details and quantity required. If the requested item is found in local storage, our application will automatically notify the incharge of local storage to transport the product to the user. The administrator keeps track of all tickets generated and their status.
